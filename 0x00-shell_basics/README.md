<h1>**What is the Shell**</h1>

*- What is the shell*

The Shell is the program that takes commands from the Keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. 

*- What is the difference between a terminal and a shell*

The difference between the terminal and the Shell is that the terminal is a program that acts as an emulator between the user and the Shell, so when we want to use our terminal, a window will open for us and let us interact with the shell.

*- What is the shell prompt*

The Shell prompt is the username and the name of the machine followed by a dollar sign, something like this: [me@linuxbox me] $

*- How to use the history (the basics)*

The history is nothing more than the command we previously used, so if we use the up arrow, we will be able to see the previous command used, if we use the down arrow, the command will disappear again, and if we use the right and left arrows we can position the text cursor anywhere in the command line. This allows us to correct mistakes easily.
